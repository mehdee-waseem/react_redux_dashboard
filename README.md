# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Product Dashboard

## Overview

A clean and responsive product dashboard built with React and Redux Toolkit. The dashboard showcases various items including jewelry, clothes, and electronics. Users can add items to the cart and remove them as needed. The application uses demo data for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices.
- **Cart Management**: Add and remove items from the cart.
- **Demo Data**: Uses placeholder data for products.

## Components Structure

### Components:
- **Dasboard.js**: Main dashboard component displaying products.
- **Product.js**: Component for rendering individual product items.

### Store:
- **cartSlice.js**: Redux slice for managing cart state with actions to add and remove items.

### Other Source Files:
- **index.js**: Entry point of the application.
- **store.js**: Configuration of Redux store.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-redux-product-dashboard.git
   cd react-redux-product-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Development Mode**:
   - Run `npm start` to start the development server.
   - Make changes to the source code and see them reflected instantly.

2. **Production Build**:
   - Run `npm run build` to create an optimized build of the application.
   - Deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your preferred web server.
